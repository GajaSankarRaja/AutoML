# AutoML
**AutoML Frameworks and Manual Model Fitting with Deployment on Gradio**

**Project Overview**
This project explores and compares the performance of machine learning models developed using AutoML frameworks and manual model fitting. Specifically, the following frameworks and tools were utilized:

**H2O AutoML**

**PyCaret**

**Manual model fitting using traditional machine learning techniques.**

The models were deployed using Gradio for a user-friendly interface to test their predictions. Finally, the performance of all models was compared to understand their strengths and limitations.

**Key Features**

*1. *H2O AutoML**

Automated machine learning framework that handles preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and stacking.

Supports multiple algorithms including GLM, GBM, XGBoost, and Deep Learning.

Generates a leaderboard ranking models based on performance metrics.

**2. *PyCaret**

Simplified end-to-end machine learning pipeline with automated feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

Provides easy comparison of multiple algorithms.

Highly customizable and integrates seamlessly with popular deployment tools like Gradio.

*3. *Manual Model Fitting**

Models were manually trained and optimized using:

Algorithms Multiple linear Regression to predict the values of yeild of a rice.

*****4. *Gradio Deployment****

Deployed all models on Gradio, enabling an interactive interface for users to input data and view predictions.

Facilitated real-time testing and evaluation of model predictions by en
